//It is constructed as a tree of objects.

//In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

//It has a window object and it has a parent HTML object. HTML object has Head and Body.
//Head has two parts (Title) & (Meta). Title has text node and Meta has attribute.

//Let's say Body has div and div has h1 & P tag. 
//H1 has also two tags. attribute and text node
//P has one text node.
